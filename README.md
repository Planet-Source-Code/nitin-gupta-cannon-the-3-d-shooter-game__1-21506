### Description

The code can be used as a 3-D engine without using any kind of external 3-D stuff and the whole game has been made using Bitblt API. An easy to understand code, making such a game is no joke. See it for yourself, and I bet you wont be dissapointed to see my own Doom.

The game Cannon online again - which is actually an improvement over Simon Price's 3-D Amazing. This makes you feel it more like a game, with stuff like sound effects, enemies, new levels, more textures and movements. Perfect collision detecttion. Credits for Ray-tracing and rendering (algo) go to Mr. Simon Price.
